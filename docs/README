Simple Groupware Installer

The installer for Simple Groupware helps downloading the latest release, extracts the archive and starts the setup.
So it is no longer necessary to copy all the extracted files via FTP.
Setting permissions is also easier, since only one directory needs to be made writable.
The installer has only 26 KB and works on systems not connected to the internet by using a local archive file of Simple Groupware.
